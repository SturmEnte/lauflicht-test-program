# lauflicht-test-program

This is a test program for the curcuit in the image bellow. The delays got replaced by millis funcions.

## Features
The LED D2 to D11 will go on from D2 to D11 and then go off again from D11 to D2 with a small delay in between the on and of turnings. The speed of this will
exponentionaly increase when pressed. The delay resets when the button is not pressed any more. The left button freezes the leds (D2 to D11) in their current
state until you stop pressing it. The leds A0 to A3 will blink. The speed of this blink is set by the adjustable resistors. The left for the two leds on the
left side and the one on the right for the to leds on the right.
